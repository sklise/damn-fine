title: Damn Fine Things
---

A collection of things that I think are pretty much the best, damn fine-est things within their category.

## Gear

#### **Backpack**: [Boreas Bootlegger][bootlegger]

Boreas makes some amazing packs, both for around the city and backpacking. This one in particular is my favorite. First of all it's three packs in one, each bag can be used with the same straps/suspension. And then for those hot days you can set the suspension to bend away from your back leaving just mesh. No more sweaty backs.

#### **Headphones**: [Sennheiser HD25-1 II][sennheiser]

The best headphones for sitting at a desk, at a coffee shop, on an airplane or on the subway. They passively block noise meaning no batteries and also none of that weird noise-cancelling ear pressure. Also, the cable only comes out of one ear meaning less tangling. You'll be sweating in these if you wear them outside on a warm day.

#### **Bike Lights**: Knog USB Rechargeable Lights [Front][knog-front] & [Back][knog-back]

These lights are awesome, very bright, small enough to fit in your pockets when you lock up your bike. Also, the recharge via USB, no more batteries.

## Clothes

#### **Pants**: [Outlier Slim Dungarees](http://shop.outlier.cc/shop/retail/slim-dungarees.html)

Not quite jeans, because they aren't cotton, but the best pair of pants. I've been wearing them pretty much every day for over a year. These pants show no signs of wearing. Outlier's goal is to make clothes so good you only need one pair. Well worth the price.

#### **Midweight Jacket**: [Patagonia Shelled Synchilla][patagonia-shelled]

This seems to maybe have been discontinued, I really hope not, it's great. Wind proof and insulated.
