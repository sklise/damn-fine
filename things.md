title: Damn Fine Things
---

A collection of things that I think are pretty much the best, damn fine-est things within their category. This page is something like [The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/) with less research and more biased opinions.

## Gear

- **Backpack**: _not sure right now_

- **Bike Lights**: Knog USB Rechargeable Lights [Front][knog-front] & [Back][knog-back]

    These lights are awesome, very bright, small enough to fit in your pockets when you lock up your bike. Also, the recharge via USB, no more batteries.

- **Bike Helmet**: [Uvex i-vo cc][uvex]
    
    I tried on a few hard-shell helmets before buying this one and it was by far the most comfortable. The adjustments for the helmet are excellent and comfortable. Compared to my previous helmet the airflow through this is much better making rides in the summer way more enjoyable.

- **Duffel Bag**: [REI Classic Duffel][duffel]
    
    I hate roller bags, they are awkward to carry, hard to roll on a sidewalk and take up so much space when not in use. Duffel bags are better. Good as a carryon but you need to be careful of the contents if checking.

## Clothes

- **Pants**: [Outlier Slim Dungarees][outlier-dungarees]

    Not quite jeans, because they aren't cotton, but the best pair of pants. I've been wearing them pretty much every day for over a year. These pants show no signs of wearing. Outlier's goal is to make clothes so good you only need one pair. Well worth the price.

- **Shorts**: [Outlier New Way][outlier-shorts]

    With one pair of Outlier Dungarees and one pair of New Way shorts you'd be set for pretty much the entire year. These suckers wear like pants but don't ever get in your way. Whether walking, hiking, biking or swimming these shorts can do it all.

- **T-Shirt**: [Patagonia Daily Tee][patagonia-t]
    
    This shirt is like buying organic eggs for a t-shirt. It's more expensive than a normal cotton t-shirt and at first you're like "I guess," and then once you put it on you realize that yes, this shirt was totally worth the extra dollars. 

- **Midweight Jacket**: [Patagonia Shelled Synchilla][patagonia-shelled]

    This seems to maybe have been discontinued, I really hope not, it's great. Wind proof and insulated.

## Electronics

### Headphones/Earphones 

- **On Ear**: [Sennheiser HD25-1 II][sennheiser]
    
    The best headphones for sitting at a desk, at a coffee shop, on an airplane or on the subway. They passively block noise meaning no batteries and also none of that weird noise-cancelling ear pressure. Also, the cable only comes out of one ear meaning less tangling. You'll be sweating in these if you wear them outside on a warm day.

- **In Ear**: [Bose Quiet Comfort 20i][bose]

    The Sennheiser's have generally better sound but these are amazing for their portability as well as noise cancelling, which is a game changer for plane flights. The noise cancelling dongle is small and doesn't get in the way.

## iOS Apps

- **Paying friends**: [Square Cash](https://square.com/cash/)

    Square cash is really so much better than basically any service out there. Their app is extremely easy to use, and if you don't want to involve an app, you can send an email and CC cash@square.com and bam, payments.

- **Weather**: [Dark Sky](http://darkskyapp.com/)

    The newest version of Dark Sky is much faster than the old one. And their API is used by many many weather apps. In a quick glance, I can see the low and high for the day as well as the current temperature.

- **To Do Lists**: [Clear](http://realmacsoftware.com/clear)
- **New York Subway**: [Kickmap](http://www.kickmap.com/)
- **Calculator**: [Pcalc](http://www.pcalc.com/)
- **Calendar**: [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone)
- **Notes/Writing**: 

    - [Vesper](http://vesperapp.co/)
    
        My new schtick is having as few apps on my phone as is reasonable. And as such Vesper is now listed before Writer Pro. It's simple. Do I need a markdown keyboard when I am taking quick notes on my phone? Do I? Really? No, I don't.

    - [Writer Pro](http://writer.pro/)

        But sometimes, yes, I do want a markdown keyboard and the custom keyboard and support of Markdown formatting has made Write Pro rise above every other writing app I've tried. And yes I've tried a lot. You can buy Writer Pro for Mac and view/edit your notes via iCloud.
    
- **Camera**: [VSCO Cam](http://vsco.co/vscocam)

    This app just got so much better. Comes with some very nice filters that you can tweak and also more filters to buy. Also has a social aspect where you can share one photo at a time or make "journal" posts. [Here's my page](http://sklise.vsco.co/).
    
- **Podcasts**: [Castro](http://castro.fm/)
- **Running**: [Nike Running](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/running/nikeplus/gps-app)
    
    Nike Running is exactly what I need from a running app. It tells me my time and pace every mile. And when I've finished a run I get a nice view of where I went and can even keep track of how each run felt.

    And then in big numbers the app shows me how many miles I've tracked over all time with the app, my overall average pace and then a list of my friends and how much they've ran this month. Totals. I'm not running races, and even if I was, I wouldn't be winning them. This is what I want from a running app: motivation and simple stats.

## Coffee

If you are trying to make better coffee at home the two most important aspects are a good grinder and good beans. Start there. Then get in to pour over methods and ensuring the right temperature of water (93&deg;C).

- **Grinders**: 
    - **Electric**: [Baratza Encore][grinder] Over $100, under $200. Hitting the sweet spot for most uses. Great for when you make coffee for two or more.
    - **Hand Powered**: [Porlex Mini][porlex] Suitable only for one cup of coffee at a time. This grinder is beautiful, packs down small but will get you stopped by TSA because it shows up like something mysterious on the x-ray.


- **Brew Method**: [Kalita Wave 155][kalita155]
- **Iced Coffee**: [Counter Culture's Japanese Iced Coffee Method][iced]

    The best thing about making iced coffee this way is the flavor. The second best is that you don't need to plan 12 hours in advance to enjoy it. All you need is your pour over device and some ice cubes.

- **Beans to Water Ratio**: 60g Coffee / 1000 mL Water

    Specialty coffee shops all across the country all recommend a ratio very close to 60g/1000mL. It works well for me. If you're extra fussy, you can start here and try different amounts.
