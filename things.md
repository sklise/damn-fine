title: Damn Fine Things
---

A collection of things that I think are pretty much the best, damn fine-est things within their category.

## Gear

- **Backpack**: [Boreas Bootlegger][bootlegger]

    Boreas makes some amazing packs, both for around the city and backpacking. This one in particular is my favorite. First of all it's three packs in one, each bag can be used with the same straps/suspension. And then for those hot days you can set the suspension to bend away from your back leaving just mesh. No more sweaty backs.

- **Bike Lights**: Knog USB Rechargeable Lights [Front][knog-front] & [Back][knog-back]

    These lights are awesome, very bright, small enough to fit in your pockets when you lock up your bike. Also, the recharge via USB, no more batteries.

- **Duffel Bag**: [REI Classic Duffel][duffel]
    
    I hate roller bags, they are awkward to carry, hard to roll on a sidewalk and take up so much space when not in use. Duffel bags are better. Good as a carryon but you need to be careful of the contents if checking.

## Clothes

- **Pants**: [Outlier Slim Dungarees](http://shop.outlier.cc/shop/retail/slim-dungarees.html)

    Not quite jeans, because they aren't cotton, but the best pair of pants. I've been wearing them pretty much every day for over a year. These pants show no signs of wearing. Outlier's goal is to make clothes so good you only need one pair. Well worth the price.

- **T-Shirt**: [Outlier Merino Shirt](#)
    
    This shirt is light and comfortable and can be worn for many days at a time. You'll need less of these than your other shirts.

-  **Midweight Jacket**: [Patagonia Shelled Synchilla][patagonia-shelled]

    This seems to maybe have been discontinued, I really hope not, it's great. Wind proof and insulated.

## Headphones/Earphones 

- **On Ear**: [Sennheiser HD25-1 II][sennheiser]
    
    The best headphones for sitting at a desk, at a coffee shop, on an airplane or on the subway. They passively block noise meaning no batteries and also none of that weird noise-cancelling ear pressure. Also, the cable only comes out of one ear meaning less tangling. You'll be sweating in these if you wear them outside on a warm day.

- **In Ear**: [Bose Quiet Comfort 20i][bose]

    The Sennheiser's have generally better sound but these are amazing for their portability as well as noise cancelling, which is a game changer for plane flights. The noise cancelling dongle is small and doesn't get in the way.

## Misc.

- **Ballpoint Pen**: [Caran d'Ache Ballpoint 849][caran]
- **Notebook**: Muji [A5][a5] & [A6][a6]

## iOS Apps

- **Weather**: [Check the Weather](http://checktheweather.co/)
- **To Do Lists**: [Clear](http://realmacsoftware.com/clear)
- **New York Subway**: [Kickmap](http://www.kickmap.com/)
- **Paying friends**: [Square Cash](https://square.com/cash/)
- **Calculator**: [Pcalc](http://www.pcalc.com/)
- **Calendar**: [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone)
- **Notes/Writing**: [Writer Pro](http://writer.pro/)

    The custom keyboard and support of Markdown formatting has made Write Pro rise above every other writing app I've tried. And yes I've tried a lot. You can buy Writer Pro for Mac and view/edit your notes via iCloud.

- **Camera**: [VSCO Cam](http://vsco.co/vscocam)
- **Podcasts**: [Castro](http://castro.fm/)

## Coffee

- **Brew Method**: [Kalita Wave 155][kalita155]
- **Iced Coffee**: [Counter Culture's Japanese Iced Coffee Method][iced]
- **Grinder**: [Baratza Encore][grinder]

    There are better grinders, this one is sufficient for me for now.

- **Beans to Water Ratio**: 60g Coffee / 1000 mL Water
- **Roasters**
    + [Cafe Grumpy][grumpy] New York, NY
    + [Fourbarrel][fourbarrel] San Francisco, CA
