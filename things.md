## Gear

- **Backpack**: [Boreas Bootlegger][bootlegger]

    Boreas makes some amazing packs, both for around the city and backpacking. This one in particular is my favorite. First of all it's three packs in one, each bag can be used with the same straps/suspension. And then for those hot days you can set the suspension to bend away from your back leaving just mesh. No more sweaty backs.

- **Bike Lights**: Knog USB Rechargeable Lights [Front][knog-front] & [Back][knog-back]

    These lights are awesome, very bright, small enough to fit in your pockets when you lock up your bike. Also, the recharge via USB, no more batteries.

- **Bike Helmet**: [Uvex i-vo cc][uvex]
    
    I tried on a few hard-shell helmets before buying this one and it was by far the most comfortable. The adjustments for the helmet are excellent and comfortable. Compared to my previous helmet the airflow through this is much better making rides in the summer way more enjoyable.

- **Duffel Bag**: [REI Classic Duffel][duffel]
    
    I hate roller bags, they are awkward to carry, hard to roll on a sidewalk and take up so much space when not in use. Duffel bags are better. Good as a carryon but you need to be careful of the contents if checking.

## Clothes

- **Pants**: [Outlier Slim Dungarees][outlier-dungarees]

    Not quite jeans, because they aren't cotton, but the best pair of pants. I've been wearing them pretty much every day for over a year. These pants show no signs of wearing. Outlier's goal is to make clothes so good you only need one pair. Well worth the price.

- **Shorts**: [Outlier New Way][outlier-shorts]

    With one pair of Outlier Dungarees and one pair of New Way shorts you'd be set for pretty much the entire year. These suckers wear like pants but don't ever get in your way. Whether walking, hiking, biking or swimming these shorts can do it all.

- **T-Shirt**: [Outlier Ultrafine Merino T-Shirt][outlier-t]
    
    This shirt is light and comfortable and can be worn for many days at a time. You'll need less of these than your other shirts.

- **Lightweight Jacket**: [REI Windstill Jacket][rei-windstill]

    This super lightweight jacket is nice for those spring and fall days where you're never sure if you'll need a jacket. Leave it in your bag and get it out if it gets windy or a bit rainy.

- **Midweight Jacket**: [Patagonia Shelled Synchilla][patagonia-shelled]

    This seems to maybe have been discontinued, I really hope not, it's great. Wind proof and insulated.

## Electronics

### Headphones/Earphones 

- **On Ear**: [Sennheiser HD25-1 II][sennheiser]
    
    The best headphones for sitting at a desk, at a coffee shop, on an airplane or on the subway. They passively block noise meaning no batteries and also none of that weird noise-cancelling ear pressure. Also, the cable only comes out of one ear meaning less tangling. You'll be sweating in these if you wear them outside on a warm day.

- **In Ear**: [Bose Quiet Comfort 20i][bose]

    The Sennheiser's have generally better sound but these are amazing for their portability as well as noise cancelling, which is a game changer for plane flights. The noise cancelling dongle is small and doesn't get in the way.

## iOS Apps

- **Weather**: [Weather Line](http://weatherlineapp.com/)
- **To Do Lists**: [Clear](http://realmacsoftware.com/clear)
- **New York Subway**: [Kickmap](http://www.kickmap.com/)
- **Paying friends**: [Square Cash](https://square.com/cash/)
- **Calculator**: [Pcalc](http://www.pcalc.com/)
- **Calendar**: [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone)
- **Notes/Writing**: 
    
    - [Writer Pro](http://writer.pro/)

        The custom keyboard and support of Markdown formatting has made Write Pro rise above every other writing app I've tried. And yes I've tried a lot. You can buy Writer Pro for Mac and view/edit your notes via iCloud.
    
    - [Vesper](http://vesperapp.co/)
    
        Less features than Writer Pro above, but cheaper and faster. When I really want to write something down really fast, this is what I go with. Also, you can attach an image to each note.

- **Camera**: [VSCO Cam](http://vsco.co/vscocam)

    This app just got so much better. Comes with some very nice filters that you can tweak and also more filters to buy. Also has a social aspect where you can share one photo at a time or make "journal" posts. [Here's my page](http://sklise.vsco.co/).

## Computing

### Sublime Text

- [Package Manager](https://sublime.wbond.net/)
- [MarkdownEditing](https://github.com/SublimeText-Markdown/MarkdownEditing/)
- [Outerspace Theme](https://github.com/sklise/outerspace)
- My favorite settings:

        "detect_indentation": true,
        "draw_centered": true,
        "draw_white_space": "all",
        "find_selected_text": "true",
        "scroll_past_end": true,
        "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true,
        "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true

## Coffee

If you are trying to make better coffee at home the two most important aspects are a good grinder and good beans. Start there. Then get in to pour over methods and ensuring the right temperature of water (93&deg;C).

- **Grinders**: 
    - **Electric**: [Baratza Encore][grinder] Over $100, under $200. Hitting the sweet spot for most uses. Great for when you make coffee for two or more.
    - **Hand Powered**: [Porlex Mini][porlex] Suitable only for one cup of coffee at a time. This grinder is beautiful, packs down small but will get you stopped by TSA because it shows up like something mysterious on the x-ray.


- **Brew Method**: [Kalita Wave 155][kalita155]
- **Iced Coffee**: [Counter Culture's Japanese Iced Coffee Method][iced]

    The best thing about making iced coffee this way is the flavor. The second best is that you don't need to plan 12 hours in advance to enjoy it. All you need is your pour over device and some ice cubes.

- **Beans to Water Ratio**: 60g Coffee / 1000 mL Water

    Specialty coffee shops all across the country all recommend a ratio very close to 60g/1000mL. It works well for me. If you're extra fussy, you can start here and try different amounts.
