title: Damn Fine Things
---

A collection of things that I think are pretty much the best, damn fine-est things within their category.

## Gear

#### **Backpack**: [Boreas Bootlegger](http://www.boreasgear.com/collections/super-tramp/products/bootlegger-eclipse-black)

Boreas makes some amazing packs, both for around the city and backpacking. This one in particular is my favorite. First of all it's three packs in one, each bag can be used with the same straps/suspension. And then for those hot days you can set the suspension to bend away from your back leaving just mesh. No more sweaty backs.

## Clothes

#### **Pants**: [Outlier Slim Dungarees](http://shop.outlier.cc/shop/retail/slim-dungarees.html)

Not quite jeans, because they aren't cotton, but the best pair of pants. I've been wearing them pretty much every day for over a year. These pants show no signs of wearing. Outlier's goal is to make clothes so good you only need one pair. Well worth the price.
